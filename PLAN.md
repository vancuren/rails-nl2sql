# Plan for Improving rails-nl2sql Gem

This document outlines a plan to improve the `rails-nl2sql` gem. The focus is on improving the developer experience, expanding the gem's capabilities, and making it more robust.

## 1. Improve Developer Experience

*   **Add a command-line interface (CLI):** A CLI would make it easier for developers to use the gem without having to write code. The CLI could be used to generate queries, get schema information, and more.
*   **Improve the documentation:** The documentation should be more comprehensive and include more examples. It should also be easier to navigate.
*   **Add a debug mode:** A debug mode would make it easier for developers to troubleshoot problems with the gem. The debug mode could log information about the queries that are being generated, the schema that is being used, and more.

## 2. Expand Capabilities

*   **Add support for more database adapters:** The gem currently only supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. It would be beneficial to add support for other popular database adapters, such as Oracle and SQL Server.
*   **Add support for more LLM providers:** The gem currently only supports OpenAI, Anthropic and Llama. It would be beneficial to add support for other popular LLM providers, such as Google's Gemini.
*   **Add support for more complex queries:** The gem currently only supports simple SELECT queries. It would be beneficial to add support for more complex queries, such as queries with joins, subqueries, and window functions.

## 3. Make the Gem More Robust

*   **Add more tests:** The gem currently has a good test suite, but it could be improved. More tests should be added to cover all of the gem's functionality.
*   **Add more error handling:** The gem currently has some error handling, but it could be improved. More error handling should be added to handle all possible errors that could occur.
*   **Add a performance benchmark:** A performance benchmark would help to ensure that the gem is performing well. The benchmark could be used to track the performance of the gem over time and to identify any performance bottlenecks.

## 4. Improve the Codebase

*   **Refactor the code:** The code could be refactored to make it more modular and easier to understand.
*   **Add more comments:** The code could be better commented to make it easier for other developers to understand.
*   **Use a consistent coding style:** The code should be formatted using a consistent coding style.

This is just a high-level plan. More detailed planning will be required for each of these items.
